In this article, we will review some of the new and improved features of Adobe After Effects CC 2017 v15.5 that make it a powerful and versatile tool for any creative project.
 
## Lumetri Scopes and Color Correction Tools
 
One of the biggest and most important changes in Adobe After Effects CC 2017 v15.5 is the introduction of Lumetri scopes. These are different waveforms and vectorscopes that help you with color correction, by providing real-time feedback on the color and exposure of your footage. You can access them in the After Effects Color workspace, and choose from different scopes depending on the calibration you want to make.
 
You also have access to a Color Correction Lumetri effect, where you can adjust all the parameters of your footage's color, such as exposure, contrast, temperature, tint, saturation, curves, color wheels, and more. You can also apply creative looks and LUTs to give your footage a specific mood or style.
 
These new color correction tools are designed for video, not still images, and they are compatible with Premiere Pro, so you can easily switch between the two applications without losing any quality or settings.
 
## Essential Graphics Panel and Motion Graphics Templates
 
Another interesting development in Adobe After Effects CC 2017 v15.5 is the Essential Graphics Panel. This is where you can create complex template effects that can be used and edited in Premiere Pro. For example, you can create animated lower thirds, titles, logos, transitions, or any other graphics that you want to reuse in different projects or share with other editors.
 
To create a motion graphics template, you simply drag and drop your composition from the Project panel to the Essential Graphics panel. Then you can choose which properties you want to expose for editing in Premiere Pro, such as text, color, position, scale, opacity, etc. You can also add comments and instructions for the editors who will use your template.
 
Once you have created your template, you can export it as a .mogrt file and import it into Premiere Pro. There you can access it from the Essential Graphics panel and drag and drop it onto your timeline. You can then edit the properties of the template using the Effect Controls panel.
 
This feature allows you to create consistent and professional graphics across different projects and platforms, and save time and effort by reusing your work.
 
## GPU Accelerated Effects and Performance Improvements
 
Adobe After Effects CC 2017 v15.5 also offers plenty of GPU accelerated effects that improve the performance and quality of your work. For example, you can use the new Gaussian Blur effect that uses GPU rendering for faster previews and renders. You can also use the new VR effects that allow you to work with 360-degree video footage in After Effects.
 
Other GPU accelerated effects include Fractal Noise, Levels, Lumetri Color, Sharpen, Transform, Turbulent Noise, Unsharp Mask, Venetian Blinds, Video Limiter, VR Blur, VR Chromatic Aberrations, VR Color Gradients, VR Converter, VR De-Noise, VR Digital Glitch, VR Fractal Noise, VR Glow, VR Plane to Sphere, VR Rotate Sphere, VR Sharpen, and VR Sphere to Plane.
 
In addition to these effects, Adobe After Effects CC 2017 v15.5 also improves the overall performance of the software by optimizing memory usage, rendering engine, and user interface responsiveness.
